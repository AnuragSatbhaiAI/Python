Module 2: Basic Python Concepts
 
Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
o	Addition
o	Subtraction
o	Multiplication
o	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

num_1 = float(input("Enter the first number : "))
num_2 = float(input("Enter the second number : "))

add = num_1 + num_2
sub = num_1 - num_2
mul = num_1 * num_2
div = num_1 / num_2

print("Addition : ",add)
print("Subtraction : ",sub)
print("Multiplication : ",mul)
print("Division : ",div)
