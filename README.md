# Python
Python: Clean code, powerful results.


Task_1.py functionality

It takes two inputs from the user and converts them into floats, so decimals are allowed.
It then performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Finally, it prints the results.

Limitation: It gives an error if the second number is zero.


Task_2.py functionality

The program takes the userâ€™s first name and last name as input.
It then combines them into a full name by adding a space in between.
Finally, it prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.

Limitation: If the user leaves either the first name or last name blank, the program will still print a greeting, but it may look incomplete.
